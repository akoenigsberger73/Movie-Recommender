# Movie-Recommender
Neural Networks as Recommender Systems
This will be a movie recommender based on user inputted parameters. The user will input desired genre, decade of release, rating, and rotten tomatoes score, and based on these criteria will be shown a movie recommendation. It will be modeled after a neural network with each parameter representing a layer of a neural network.
